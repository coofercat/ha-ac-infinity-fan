# Boost Button 3D Printed box

Three files are provided:

| File                                   | Comments                                                      |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [button-bottom.stl](button-bottom.stl) | The bottom lid of the button box, in STL format               |
| [button-top.stl] (button-top.stl)      | The top rounded part of the box, in STL format                |
| [boost-button.3mf](boost-button.3mf)   | Both top and bottom of the box in a Bambu Studio project file |

Both the top and bottom part need support to print successfully. On my Bambu AI with a single filament, support in "Normal Tree mode" worked well. Otherwise no special settings are required. Some experimentation may be required.
