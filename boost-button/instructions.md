| Instructions | Picture |
| ------------ | ------- |
| Firstly, take one of the keyfind fobs... | [<img src="1-the-tag.jpg" width="300" height="auto" align="right">](11-the-tag.jpg) |
| ...and open it up. You can prize the two parts of the case apart, perhaps by inserting a small screwdriver in between them around the lanyard loop.| [<img src="2-the-tag-opened-up.jpg" width="300" height="auto" align="right">](2-the-tag-opened-up.jpg) |
| Take the circuit board and desolder the battery connectors. | [<img src="3-the-board-with-connectors-removed.jpg" width="300" height="auto" align="right">](3-the-board-with-connectors-removed.jpg) |
| Take the top part of the hockey puck box... | [<img src="4-hockey-puck-box-top.jpg" width="300" height="auto" align="right">](4-hockey-puck-box-top.jpg) |
| Fit the mushroom button into the box. | [<img src="5-button-mounted-on-box.jpg" width="300" height="auto" align="right">](5-button-mounted-on-box.jpg) |
| ...and tighten the retaining nut as far as possible. You may want to use a small screwdriver to rotate the nut, whilst pushing the button into the box to compress the rubber seals. | [<img src="6-button-in-box-rear.jpg" width="300" height="auto" align="right">](6-button-in-box-rear.jpg) |
| Insert the beacon board in the inside of the case. | [<img src="7-beacon-board-in-place.jpg" width="300" height="auto" align="right">](7-beacon-board-in-place.jpg) |
| Next, insert one of the two battery holders and screw it into place. Cut the black (negative) wire and solder it to the beacon board. Cut and join the red wire and the black wire of the second battery holder together. | [<img src="8-battery-holder-construction.jpg" width="300" height="auto" align="right">](8-battery-holder-construction.jpg) |
| Mount the second battery holder and screw it into place. This will secure the beacon board into place. Cut the red wire and screw it into one of the switch terminals. | [<img src="9-power-connections.jpg" width="300" height="auto" align="right">](9-power-connections.jpg) |
| Solder some wire to the battery terminal on the beacon board and screw the other end into the second switch terminal. Finally, screw the bottom of the hockey puck to the top using four small screws. | [<img src="10-completed-electronics.jpg" width="300" height="auto" align="right">](10-completed-electronics.jpg) |
| The boost button is now complete. | [<img src="11-completed-button.jpg" width="300" height="auto" align="right">](10-completed-button.jpg) |
